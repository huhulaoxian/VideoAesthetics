# ImageAesthetics

Aesthetics in photography is how people usually characterize beauty in this form of art.

High-level judgments, i.e., users' perception, of design have been shown to be correlated to low-level features of the appearance. Prior works suggest that the aesthetic and affective responses aroused by the visual appearnace of a design influence users' perception and experience.
